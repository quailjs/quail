<p>Harmonica sounds play softly in the background. The setting is a small dusty town in the wild
west days. The opening shot is the main street of the town under the bright noon sun. The harmonica sounds stop and only the wind can be heard softly. A tall man dressed all in black wearing
a black hat stands at the far end of the street. The shot changes to a closeup of the man's emotionless face. He spits tobacco juice on the ground but leaves some brown liquid dripping down his chin. He slowly speaks the words "It's about time now sheriff".</p>
