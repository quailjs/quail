          But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
          and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the
          system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth,
          the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
          pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know
          how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
          painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
          pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
          occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take
          a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
          except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find
          fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
          or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure.
